# 🐎 2026 Lunar New Year: Fire Horse Experience

A high-fidelity, standalone web experiment featuring a **magnetic UI interaction** and a real-time countdown to the Lunar New Year. This project explores the intersection of modern frontend physics, glassmorphism, and cultural storytelling.

## 🚀 The Vision

This project was born out of a personal tradition. Every year, I look forward to the Lunar New Year and the sense of renewal it brings. My goal was to build a digital celebration—a countdown that feels as energetic and dynamic as the festival itself. The project focuses on "Micro-interactions" that provide instant feedback to the user, making the interface feel alive.

## 🛠️ Technical Features

* **Engaging Responsiveness:** Implemented a magnetic UI where the interface "meets the user," mirroring the welcoming spirit of the New Year. A custom Vanilla JS implementation that calculates cursor distance from the element's center to create a "magnetic pull" effect.
* **Accessibility (A11y) First:**
  * Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries to disable physics for sensitive users.
  * High-contrast text shadows ensure legibility against a dynamic, swirling background.
  * Semantic HTML structure for screen reader compatibility.


* **Glassmorphism UI:** Utilizes `backdrop-filter: blur()` and transparent borders to create a premium, frosted-glass aesthetic.
* **Dynamic Cultural Integration:** A "Word of the Day" feature that cycles through traditional Chinese *Chengyu* (idioms) related to the Year of the Horse.

## 📦 Tech Stack

* **HTML5/CSS3:** Custom properties (variables) and CSS Grid.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Zero-dependency logic for performance and lightweight hosting.
* **Google Fonts:** `Orbitron` for high-tech headings and `Space Mono` for stable numerical countdowns.

### 🏮 Cultural Insight: The Fire Horse (2026)

In the Chinese Zodiac, the **Horse** is a symbol of speed, strength, and freedom. However, 2026 is specifically a **Fire Horse** year ($丙午 - Bǐngwǔ$), which occurs when the Horse zodiac sign coincides with the "Fire" element from the Heavenly Stems.

* **The 60-Year Cycle:** This rare alignment last occurred in 1966. It represents an era of peak energy, intense creativity, and rapid progress.
* **The Energy:** In traditional philosophy, "Fire" is the most dynamic of the five elements. When paired with the Horse, it suggests a year of "unbridled passion"—a theme I reflected in the UI through high-contrast glows and fluid, magnetic motion.
* **The Eclipse Synergy:** Uniquely, the 2026 Lunar New Year (February 17) coincides with an **annular solar eclipse**. This "Ring of Fire" in the sky perfectly mirrors the "Fire" element of the year, making this specific New Year one of the most astrologically significant in a lifetime.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `lunar-new-year.html` file.
2. Ensure the background image is in the root directory.
3. Open in any modern evergreen browser.
